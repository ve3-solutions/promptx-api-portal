All use cases assume: - Explicit organisational approval - Policy-controlled access - Human accountability - Auditability and monitoring Use Case 1: Internal Workflow Automation PromptX APIs are commonly used to automate internal workflows such as: - Knowledge retrieval - Draft analysis - Structured summarisation - Decision support (non-autonomous) Automation is always implemented with defined guardrails and review points. Use Case 2: Secure Research & Analysis Pipelines Organisations use PromptX APIs to: - Analyse large document sets - Query governed knowledge bases - Support research and policy work These pipelines prioritise traceability, data boundaries, and responsible interpretation of outputs. Use Case 3: Embedded Assistants in Enterprise Tools PromptX APIs can be embedded into: - Internal portals - Case management systems - Knowledge management platforms Assistants are configured using approved prompts and policies, ensuring consistent and safe behaviour across users. Use Case 4: Public-Facing Support Chat for Government Services (UK Government \u2013 Fuel Finder Support) PromptX APIs were used to support a public-facing chat experience for a UK Government fuel information service. Scenario The service required a scalable, reliable support chat capability to help users understand fuel pricing, availability, and related guidance. Solution PromptX was used to: - Create a governed knowledge stack containing Fuel Finder content - Configure shared workspace prompts to ensure consistent responses - Expose a single, controlled API endpoint for chat interactions - Enable millions of concurrent users to converse over the same authoritative knowledge base Key Characteristics One API endpoint serving high-volume, public demand Centralised prompt governance via shared workspace features No direct exposure of underlying AI models Consistent answers derived from an approved knowledge source Built-in safeguards to prevent hallucination and misuse Why PromptX Was Suitable Model abstraction allowed future flexibility Knowledge stack ensured responses stayed grounded in official content Shared workspace prompts maintained consistency at scale API governance enabled safe public access without exposing internal controls Outcome The solution demonstrated how PromptX APIs can support large-scale, public-facing information services while maintaining enterprise-grade governance and reliability.

As such, changes to APIs, SDKs, and platform capabilities are managed carefully to minimise disruption while allowing the platform to evolve. This deprecation policy explains how changes are introduced , how deprecations are communicated , and what customers can expect . Principles of Deprecation PromptX follows these core principles when deprecating functionality: Stability First Existing integrations should continue to function without unexpected breakage. Advance Notice Deprecations are communicated well in advance of removal. Backward Compatibility Where Possible Non-breaking changes are preferred over breaking changes. Clear Migration Paths Where deprecation is necessary, alternatives or migration guidance are provided. No Silent Removal Functionality is never removed without explicit notice. What May Be Deprecated The following may be subject to deprecation: API versions or endpoints SDK versions or features Configuration options or behaviours Experimental or preview capabilities Deprecation does not imply immediate removal. Deprecation Lifecycle A typical deprecation follows this lifecycle: 1. Announcement A deprecation notice is published through: - Documentation updates - Changelog entries - Direct communication to affected customers (where applicable) The notice includes: - What is being deprecated - Why the change is necessary - Recommended alternatives - Expected timelines 2. Deprecation Period During the deprecation period: - The deprecated feature continues to function - No new functionality is added to the deprecated feature - Customers are encouraged to migrate The length of the deprecation period depends on: - Risk and impact - Usage patterns - Regulatory or security considerations 3. Removal or Disablement After the deprecation period: - The deprecated feature may be removed or disabled - Removal is communicated in advance - Customers should have had sufficient time to migrate Versioned APIs and Deprecation For versioned APIs: - Deprecated versions remain available for a defined support window - New development occurs on newer versions - Customers are encouraged to upgrade at a controlled pace Exact timelines may vary by capability. SDK Deprecation SDKs follow similar principles: - Older SDK versions may be marked as deprecated - Critical security fixes may still be applied during the support window - Customers are encouraged to upgrade to supported versions SDK deprecation does not immediately impact API availability. Emergency Changes In rare cases, PromptX may need to modify or disable functionality immediately due to: - Security vulnerabilities - Legal or regulatory requirements - Platform stability risks Such changes are treated as exceptions and are communicated as transparently as possible.

This page explains how PromptX evolves , what customers can expect from change , and how evolution is balanced with stability . Evolution Philosophy PromptX evolves according to the following principles: Stability Over Novelty New capabilities must not compromise existing integrations or governance. Enterprise-First Change Changes are evaluated through the lens of enterprise risk, compliance, and operational impact. Incremental Improvement Evolution occurs through small, controlled steps rather than disruptive rewrites. Governance Continuity New capabilities inherit existing security, policy, and audit controls by default. Evolution is intentional, not experimental by default. What Drives Platform Evolution Platform evolution may be driven by: - Customer needs and feedback - Regulatory or compliance changes - Security improvements - Reliability and performance optimisation - Advances in AI models and techniques - Operational learnings from real-world usage Not all drivers result in visible feature changes. Types of Platform Changes Non-Functional Improvements These include: - Performance optimisations - Scalability enhancements - Reliability improvements - Operational tooling updates Such changes typically do not impact integrations. Functional Enhancements Examples include: - New API capabilities - Expanded configuration options - Additional governance controls - New integration patterns Functional enhancements are introduced cautiously and may be gated. Experimental or Preview Capabilities Some features may be introduced as: - Limited availability - Preview or pilot features - Customer-specific trials These capabilities: - Are explicitly labelled - May change or be withdrawn - Are not guaranteed to become generally available Backward Compatibility PromptX prioritises backward compatibility wherever possible. When backward compatibility cannot be maintained: - Changes follow the documented Deprecation Policy - Customers are provided with advance notice - Migration guidance is supplied where applicable Backward compatibility is a design goal, not an absolute guarantee. Relationship to APIs and SDKs Platform evolution may affect: - API behaviour - SDK capabilities - Configuration options - Operational characteristics APIs and SDKs evolve in alignment with platform changes but remain subject to their own versioning and deprecation rules. No Roadmap Commitments Any references to future capabilities are: - Indicative only - Non-binding - Subject to change PromptX does not publish or commit to fixed feature delivery timelines through this portal. This protects customers from reliance on speculative functionality. Customer Impact and Communication When changes may affect customers: - Documentation is updated - Changelog entries are published - Targeted communication may be issued for material changes Customers are encouraged to review documentation regularly.

API versioning exists to allow the platform to evolve without breaking existing consumers and to provide predictability for customers operating at scale. This page explains how API versions are defined, how changes are introduced, and what customers can expect over time. Versioning Principles PromptX follows these principles when versioning APIs: Predictability API behaviour within a version remains stable. Backward Compatibility First Non-breaking changes are preferred wherever possible. Explicit Change Boundaries Breaking changes are introduced only through new API versions. Governed Exposure New versions may be gated or limited based on risk and readiness. Clear Communication Version changes are documented and communicated in advance. API Versioning Model PromptX APIs are versioned explicitly. Versions may be expressed through one or more of the following mechanisms: - Versioned base paths (e.g. /v1 , /v2 ) - Version identifiers in headers - Versioned SDK releases aligned to API versions The exact mechanism may vary by capability, but the intent remains consistent. What Constitutes a New API Version A new API version may be introduced when changes include: - Breaking request or response schema changes - Behavioural changes that alter output semantics - Changes to authentication or authorisation models - Changes that impact integration assumptions Minor enhancements that do not affect compatibility are typically introduced within the same version. Changes Within a Version Within an existing API version, PromptX may introduce: - New optional fields - Performance improvements - Bug fixes - Additional capabilities that do not alter existing behaviour Such changes are designed to be non-breaking . Version Support and Lifecycle Each API version follows a defined lifecycle: - Active \u2013 Fully supported and recommended - Deprecated \u2013 Still functional but scheduled for retirement - Retired \u2013 No longer available Deprecation and retirement follow the documented Deprecation Policy and are communicated in advance. Relationship to SDK Versioning SDK versions are aligned with API versions but are versioned independently. An SDK may support multiple API versions SDK updates may include non-breaking improvements SDK deprecation does not automatically imply API deprecation Customers are encouraged to align SDK and API versions deliberately. Version Selection and Responsibility Customers are responsible for: - Selecting the appropriate API version - Testing integrations against supported versions - Planning upgrades as part of normal lifecycle management PromptX provides documentation and guidance but does not automatically migrate integrations. Preview and Experimental Versions Some API versions or capabilities may be marked as: - Preview - Limited availability - Experimental Such versions: - May change without full backward compatibility - Are not guaranteed to reach general availability - Should not be used for critical production workloads unless explicitly approved Questions About API Versioning If you have questions about API versions, compatibility, or upgrade planning, contact the PromptX team. \ud83d\udd22 Contact About API Versioning","title":"Versioning"},{"location":"lifecycle/versioning/#api-versioning","text":"PromptX APIs are designed for long-lived enterprise integrations.

Purpose of Audit Logging Audit logging in PromptX exists to: - Support security monitoring and incident investigation - Enable compliance and regulatory review - Provide traceability of API usage - Detect misuse or anomalous behaviour - Support operational reliability Logging is designed for accountability and assurance , not surveillance. What Is Logged PromptX logs relevant metadata associated with API and platform activity, which may include: - Authentication and access events - API invocation metadata (e.g. timestamp, capability invoked) - Tenant and credential identifiers - Success and failure indicators - Administrative and configuration changes Logs focus on who did what and when , not on monitoring user intent. What Is Not Logged To protect privacy and data minimisation principles: - Full prompt or content payloads are not logged by default - Sensitive customer data is not logged unnecessarily - Logs are not used for behavioural profiling Logging is aligned with PromptX data protection and privacy commitments. Auditability and Traceability Audit logs are designed to provide: - Traceability of actions across users, services, and tenants - Evidence for internal and external audits - Support for forensic analysis when required Audit data supports accountability without exposing proprietary or personal content. Log Access and Visibility Access to logs is restricted and governed: - Logs are accessible only to authorised personnel - Administrative access is role-controlled - Customer visibility into logs may vary by deployment and agreement Logs are not publicly accessible. Retention and Protection of Logs Audit logs are: - Retained for defined periods based on operational and regulatory needs - Protected against unauthorised access - Stored securely with appropriate access controls Retention periods may vary depending on environment and contractual context. Monitoring and Alerting PromptX uses logs and telemetry to: - Detect abnormal or suspicious activity - Identify reliability or performance issues - Trigger alerts for operational or security review Monitoring is focused on platform health and risk , not individual user behaviour. Customer Responsibilities Customers are responsible for: - Using audit information appropriately - Aligning PromptX usage with organisational policies - Integrating PromptX audit outputs with their own governance processes where applicable PromptX provides audit support but does not replace organisational oversight.

However, like all distributed systems, errors can occur. This page explains how errors are categorised , how they should be handled , and what developers can expect when something goes wrong. Reliability Philosophy PromptX follows these reliability principles: Fail Predictably Errors are explicit and structured rather than silent or ambiguous. Fail Safely Errors should not result in unintended data exposure or unsafe behaviour. Support Recovery Errors are designed to enable retries, fallback, or graceful degradation. Transparency Without Leakage Error responses provide useful context without exposing sensitive internals. Categories of Errors Errors returned by PromptX APIs generally fall into the following categories. Client-Side Errors These occur when a request cannot be processed due to client input or configuration. Examples include: - Authentication or authorisation failures - Invalid or malformed requests - Requests outside approved scope or policy Client-side errors typically require request correction , not retries. Server-Side Errors These occur when the platform encounters an internal issue. Examples include: - Temporary service unavailability - Internal processing errors - Dependency failures Server-side errors are typically transient and may be retried safely. Policy and Governance Errors These occur when a request violates governance or policy constraints. Examples include: - Exceeding approved usage limits - Attempting unauthorised capabilities - Accessing restricted resources Such errors indicate a governance boundary , not a technical fault. Error Responses PromptX API error responses are structured to provide: - A clear error category - A human-readable summary - Context for diagnosis - A stable structure for programmatic handling Error responses avoid exposing: - Internal system architecture - Sensitive operational details - Customer data or prompts Retry and Backoff Guidance When to Retry Retries may be appropriate when: - Errors indicate transient server-side issues - Network interruptions occur - Rate limiting responses advise retry-after behaviour When NOT to Retry Retries should not be used when: - Requests fail due to invalid input - Authentication or authorisation fails - Policy violations are returned Uncontrolled retries can worsen failures and may trigger additional controls. Idempotency and Safe Replays Where applicable, PromptX APIs are designed to support: - Idempotent operations - Safe replay of requests after transient failures Developers should ensure: - Requests can be safely retried - Duplicate effects are avoided Graceful Degradation For production systems, PromptX recommends: - Fallback user experiences - Clear user messaging when AI assistance is unavailable - Continued operation of core business logic without AI dependency AI should enhance systems, not become a single point of failure. Observability and Correlation Error events are: - Logged for audit and investigation - Correlatable with request metadata - Used to improve platform reliability Where supported, error identifiers may be provided to assist with support requests.

All API capabilities are delivered within a defence-in-depth security model that prioritises confidentiality, integrity, availability, and accountability. This page explains how PromptX approaches API security and what customers can expect when integrating. Security-by-Design Philosophy PromptX APIs are built with security as a default condition , not an optional configuration. Key aspects include: - Least-privilege access by default - Explicit trust boundaries between tenants - Secure handling of credentials and secrets - Policy enforcement at every request Security controls are layered to reduce the impact of any single failure. Authentication and Credential Security PromptX APIs use secure, token-based authentication mechanisms. Security expectations include: - Tokens are scoped to approved capabilities - Tokens must be stored securely and never embedded in client-side code - Credential rotation is encouraged - Compromised credentials can be revoked promptly PromptX does not support anonymous API access. Authorisation and Access Control Authorisation is enforced through: - Role-based access control (RBAC) - Scope-limited credentials - Tenant isolation - Policy enforcement API calls are evaluated against approved permissions before execution. Access control applies consistently across UI and API interactions. Network and Transport Security PromptX APIs are accessible only over secure channels. Key measures include: - Encrypted communication using modern TLS standards - Protection against common network-level attacks - Controlled ingress and egress points Unencrypted or insecure connections are not supported. Data Protection and Isolation PromptX enforces strict data protection measures: - Logical isolation between tenants - Processing of customer data only for service delivery - Alignment with documented data handling and retention policies API access does not bypass data protection controls. Protection Against Abuse and Misuse To protect platform integrity, PromptX implements: - Rate limiting and quotas - Abuse detection mechanisms - Monitoring for anomalous usage patterns These controls help prevent denial-of-service, data exfiltration, and unintended usage. Secure Development and Testing PromptX follows secure development practices, including: - Code review and change management - Dependency and supply-chain risk management - Regular security testing and vulnerability assessment Security improvements are ongoing and iterative. Incident Detection and Response Security events are: - Detected through monitoring and alerts - Investigated by authorised personnel - Addressed according to defined incident response processes Customers may be notified of security incidents in line with contractual and regulatory requirements. Shared Responsibility Model Security is a shared responsibility: PromptX Responsibilities Platform security controls Infrastructure and network protection Access enforcement and audit logging Customer Responsibilities Secure credential handling Appropriate use of APIs Implementation of client-side security measures PromptX provides secure foundations but does not control customer environments. Security Expectations for Integrators When integrating with PromptX APIs, customers are expected to: - Use least-privilege access scopes - Secure secrets and credentials - Implement appropriate error handling - Monitor integrations for abnormal behaviour Failure to follow security best practices may increase risk.

If your question is not answered here, contact the PromptX team using the links provided throughout the portal. General Questions What is PromptX? PromptX is an enterprise-grade AI platform designed to enable organisations to adopt generative AI safely, securely, and at scale . PromptX combines: - Governed AI interactions - Knowledge grounding - Policy enforcement - Auditability - Human accountability Who are PromptX APIs designed for? PromptX APIs are designed for: - Enterprise engineering teams - Platform and integration teams - Public-sector and regulated organisations - Internal application and workflow integrations They are not designed for unrestricted consumer-facing AI products. Access & Governance Why is API access restricted? PromptX APIs are powerful capabilities that operate within organisational and regulatory boundaries. Restricted access ensures: - Responsible use - Policy compliance - Auditability - Protection against misuse This is a deliberate design choice, not a limitation. How do I request API access? API access requests are submitted via email and reviewed for: - Business purpose - Risk and policy alignment - Intended usage patterns Approved requests are issued scoped credentials. Can API access be revoked? Yes. API access may be revoked if: - Usage falls outside approved intent - Security risks are identified - Credentials are compromised - Access is no longer required Revocation is part of responsible governance. Technical Questions Are PromptX APIs model-specific? No. PromptX APIs abstract underlying AI models. This: - Avoids vendor lock-in - Allows model upgrades without breaking integrations - Ensures consistent governance regardless of model provider Can I use PromptX APIs for public-facing applications? Yes, with approval . Public-facing use cases (such as government information services) are supported when: - Knowledge sources are controlled - Prompts are governed - Safeguards are in place - Usage is monitored Each case is reviewed individually. Is there a sandbox environment? Sandbox or non-production environments may be provided depending on customer context and use case. Availability and scope are determined during the access approval process. Data, Privacy & Security Does PromptX store or train on my data? PromptX does not claim ownership of customer data. Customer data is processed only to deliver the service and is not used to train public or shared AI models without explicit agreement. How is customer data protected? PromptX enforces: - Tenant isolation - Secure transport (TLS) - Role-based access controls - Data handling and retention policies API access does not bypass these protections. Are prompts and responses logged? PromptX logs metadata required for audit and security purposes. Full prompt or response content is not logged unnecessarily and logging practices align with data minimisation principles. Reliability & Operations What happens if the API is unavailable? PromptX APIs are designed for reliability, but transient failures may occur. Customers are expected to: - Implement appropriate error handling - Use retries where appropriate - Design fallback behaviour AI should enhance systems, not be a single point of failure. How are breaking changes handled? Breaking changes are introduced only through: - Explicit API versioning - Advance communication - Defined deprecation periods PromptX does not remove functionality without notice. SDKs & Documentation Are SDKs required to use PromptX APIs? No. SDKs are optional. Some customers prefer SDKs for convenience and guardrails, while others integrate directly with APIs. Both approaches are supported and governed. Why isn\u2019t full API documentation public? Detailed API specifications are shared with approved consumers to: - Prevent misuse - Align documentation access with governance - Reduce risk exposure This is standard practice for enterprise platforms. Support & Escalation How do I get help? Support is provided through: - Organisational administrators - Approved support channels - PromptX platform support teams (where applicable) Escalation paths depend on severity and impact. How do I report a security or reliability issue? Security or reliability concerns should be reported promptly using the Report Issue option in the Support section. Responsible reporting helps keep the platform safe for all users. Still Have Questions?
