# Quick Start

A typical PromptX API integration follows this high-level flow:

1. Request approved API access  
2. Obtain secure credentials  
3. Authenticate using scoped tokens  
4. Invoke approved API capabilities  
5. Handle outputs responsibly  
6. Monitor and audit usage  

PromptX APIs are governed and require explicit approval before use.

## Request API Access

To request access to PromptX APIs, submit an access request outlining your intended use case.

<div style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
  <a 
    href="mailto:promptx@ve3.global
      ?subject=PromptX%20API%20Access%20Request
      &body=Hello%20PromptX%20Team,%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20would%20like%20to%20request%20API%20access%20for%20the%20following%20use%20case:%0D%0A%0D%0AOrganisation:%0D%0AUse%20Case%20Description:%0D%0AExpected%20Volume:%0D%0AEnvironment%20(Sandbox/Prod):%0D%0A%0D%0AThank%20you."

</div>

### What Happens Next?

Once your request is received:
- The use case will be reviewed for risk and policy alignment
- An administrator may follow up for clarification
- Approved credentials will be issued securely

API access may be time-bound and subject to periodic review.
