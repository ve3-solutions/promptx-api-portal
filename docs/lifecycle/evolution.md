# Platform Evolution

PromptX is designed as a long-lived enterprise platform that evolves deliberately, safely, and transparently.

This page explains **how PromptX evolves**, **what customers can expect from change**, and **how evolution is balanced with stability**.

---

## Evolution Philosophy

PromptX evolves according to the following principles:

- **Stability Over Novelty**  
  New capabilities must not compromise existing integrations or governance.

- **Enterprise-First Change**  
  Changes are evaluated through the lens of enterprise risk, compliance, and operational impact.

- **Incremental Improvement**  
  Evolution occurs through small, controlled steps rather than disruptive rewrites.

- **Governance Continuity**  
  New capabilities inherit existing security, policy, and audit controls by default.

Evolution is intentional, not experimental by default.

## What Drives Platform Evolution

Platform evolution may be driven by:
- Customer needs and feedback
- Regulatory or compliance changes
- Security improvements
- Reliability and performance optimisation
- Advances in AI models and techniques
- Operational learnings from real-world usage

Not all drivers result in visible feature changes.

---

## Types of Platform Changes

### Non-Functional Improvements
These include:
- Performance optimisations
- Scalability enhancements
- Reliability improvements
- Operational tooling updates

Such changes typically do not impact integrations.

---

### Functional Enhancements
Examples include:
- New API capabilities
- Expanded configuration options
- Additional governance controls
- New integration patterns

Functional enhancements are introduced cautiously and may be gated.

---

### Experimental or Preview Capabilities
Some features may be introduced as:
- Limited availability
- Preview or pilot features
- Customer-specific trials

These capabilities:
- Are explicitly labelled
- May change or be withdrawn
- Are not guaranteed to become generally available

---

## Backward Compatibility

PromptX prioritises backward compatibility wherever possible.

When backward compatibility cannot be maintained:
- Changes follow the documented Deprecation Policy
- Customers are provided with advance notice
- Migration guidance is supplied where applicable

Backward compatibility is a design goal, not an absolute guarantee.

---

## Relationship to APIs and SDKs

Platform evolution may affect:
- API behaviour
- SDK capabilities
- Configuration options
- Operational characteristics

APIs and SDKs evolve in alignment with platform changes but remain subject to their own versioning and deprecation rules.

---

## No Roadmap Commitments

Any references to future capabilities are:
- Indicative only
- Non-binding
- Subject to change

PromptX does not publish or commit to fixed feature delivery timelines through this portal.

This protects customers from reliance on speculative functionality.

---

## Customer Impact and Communication

When changes may affect customers:
- Documentation is updated
- Changelog entries are published
- Targeted communication may be issued for material changes

Customers are encouraged to review documentation regularly.

---

## Customer Responsibilities

Customers are responsible for:
- Staying informed of platform updates
- Testing integrations against supported versions
- Planning upgrades or configuration changes where required

PromptX provides guidance but does not automatically update customer integrations.
