# When to Use APIs vs the UI

PromptX supports both UI-based and API-based interaction models.

## Use the PromptX UI when:
- Human interaction and review are primary
- Work is exploratory or knowledge-driven
- Policy guidance and user prompts are required
- Users need contextual assistance

## Use PromptX APIs when:
- Integrating AI into internal systems
- Automating approved workflows
- Embedding AI into internal tools
- Scaling repeatable, governed processes

## Anti-patterns
PromptX APIs must not be used to:
- Bypass governance or approvals
- Enable unsupervised decision-making
- Expose AI directly to uncontrolled external users
