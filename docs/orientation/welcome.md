# Welcome to PromptX APIs

PromptX APIs allow organisations to embed AI capabilities into internal systems, tools, and workflows while maintaining **enterprise governance standards**.

These APIs inherit the same controls enforced in the PromptX user interface, including:
- Policy enforcement
- Usage monitoring
- Access controls
- Data handling guarantees

PromptX APIs are intentionally:
- Restricted rather than open
- Governed rather than self-service
- Designed for internal and enterprise use cases

This ensures AI adoption remains **intentional, safe, and auditable**.
