# Core Principles

PromptX APIs are governed by the following principles:

## Governance First
Every API call is subject to policy enforcement and audit logging.

## Model Abstraction
APIs abstract underlying AI models to avoid vendor lock-in and reduce coupling.

## Human Accountability
AI outputs are assistive and must be reviewed before action.

## Security by Design
Least privilege, tenant isolation, and encryption are enforced by default.

## Consistency with UI
APIs follow the same rules as UI interactions — no hidden capabilities.
