# API Changes & Changelog

This page provides a high-level view of how PromptX APIs have evolved over time.

PromptX has been in active use for multiple years and has evolved through **controlled, incremental improvements** rather than frequent disruptive changes.

This changelog intentionally focuses on **categories of change** rather than exhaustive technical detail.

---

## Changelog Philosophy

PromptX API changes follow these principles:

- Stability over frequent change
- Backward compatibility wherever possible
- Governance-first evolution
- Explicit versioning for breaking changes
- No silent behavioural changes

Not all improvements result in externally visible API changes.

---

## Summary of API Evolution (Indicative)

### Early Platform Foundation
Initial API capabilities focused on:
- Secure authentication and access control
- Core conversational interactions
- Tenant isolation and auditability
- Basic integration support for internal systems

These capabilities formed the stable foundation of the platform.

---

### Governance and Control Enhancements
Subsequent iterations introduced:
- Improved role-based access controls
- Policy enforcement at API boundaries
- Rate limiting and quota controls
- Enhanced audit logging and observability

These changes strengthened enterprise and public-sector readiness.

---

### Knowledge and Prompt Governance
As PromptX matured, APIs were extended to support:
- Governed knowledge stacks
- Shared workspace prompts
- Centralised prompt configuration
- Consistent behaviour across large user populations

These enhancements enabled large-scale, public-facing use cases.

---

### Scalability and Reliability Improvements
Ongoing improvements focused on:
- Performance optimisation
- Higher concurrency support
- Improved error handling and resilience
- Operational monitoring enhancements

Such changes are typically non-breaking.

---

## Versioned API Changes

Breaking changes are introduced only through **explicit versioning**.

Older versions:
- Remain available for defined support windows
- Are deprecated following the published Deprecation Policy
- Are not removed without advance notice

Exact timelines may vary by capability.

---

## Non-Functional Changes

Many platform improvements do not change API contracts, including:
- Infrastructure upgrades
- Security hardening
- Performance tuning
- Internal tooling improvements

These changes are continuous and may not appear in this changelog.

---

## Preview and Limited Availability Features

Some capabilities may be introduced as:
- Preview features
- Limited availability APIs
- Customer-specific integrations

Such features:
- Are explicitly labelled
- May evolve more rapidly
- Are not guaranteed to reach general availability

---

## Future Changelog Entries

As PromptX continues to evolve, this page may include:
- Version-specific change summaries
- High-level release notes
- Links to detailed documentation (where appropriate)

This page is intended to provide **context**, not exhaustive technical history.
