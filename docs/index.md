# PromptX API Developer Portal

Welcome to the PromptX API Developer Portal.

PromptX APIs provide **governed, enterprise-grade programmatic access** to AI capabilities, enabling organisations to integrate AI into systems and workflows **without compromising security, compliance, or accountability**.

This portal is designed for:
- Software engineers
- Platform and integration teams
- Enterprise architects
- Security and governance reviewers

Unlike consumer AI APIs, PromptX APIs operate within a **policy-controlled environment** that enforces:
- Tenant isolation
- Role-based access control
- Human accountability
- Full auditability

If you are evaluating or integrating PromptX APIs, start with **Welcome & Orientation** before requesting access.
