# API Access Overview

Access to PromptX APIs is intentionally restricted.

API access is granted based on:
- Defined business purpose
- Risk classification of the use case
- Role and responsibility of the requester
- Alignment with organisational AI policy

API access is treated as a **privileged capability**, not a default entitlement.
