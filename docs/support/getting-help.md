# Getting Help

PromptX is designed to be reliable, governed, and predictable.  
However, questions, issues, and edge cases can arise during evaluation or integration.

This page explains **how to get help**, **what types of support are available**, and **how issues are handled**.

These queries are typically handled through approved communication channels.

## How to Request Help

Support requests should include sufficient context to allow effective triage, such as:

- Description of the issue or question
- Impact or urgency
- Relevant timestamps or identifiers (where available)

Providing clear context helps reduce response time.

## Response Expectations

Support responses are prioritised based on:
- Severity and impact
- Security or compliance implications
- Operational risk

PromptX aims to respond appropriately but does not guarantee fixed response times through this portal unless contractually agreed.

---

## Shared Responsibility

PromptX provides platform-level support, including:
- API availability and reliability
- Governance and security controls
- Documentation and guidance

Customers remain responsible for:
- Application-level logic
- Error handling and retries
- User-facing messaging and fallback behaviour

Support works best when responsibilities are clearly understood.

---

## Before Contacting Support

Before raising a request, consider checking:
- Relevant documentation sections
- Error handling and logs
- Known limitations or non-goals
- Recent platform updates

This often resolves common questions quickly.

---

## When to Escalate

Escalation may be appropriate when:
- Issues impact production systems
- Security concerns are identified
- Service behaviour deviates from documented expectations

Use the **Report Issue** option for urgent or sensitive matters.

---

## Continuous Improvement

Feedback on documentation, APIs, or support processes is welcome.  
Customer feedback helps inform platform improvements and documentation updates.
